# Python-YT-Downloader-Program

This is a YouTube video downloader that I made in Python.

This program simply allows a user to input a YouTube URL into the terminal, if the user fails to input correctly then the program will output an error.
When a YouTube URL is inputted, the program will display; the title of the video, the description of the video (if possible), and, the number of views on the video.

After this, the program will then download the video into a folder specified by the user. 

WARNING
-------

You must edit the code and add the specific path to where you want the video to be downloaded!

Follow these simple steps:
1. Make a separate folder on your device
2. Copy the address of the folder
3. Open the program in an IDE
4. Paste the address into the "download_path" variable
5. Don't forget to save the edit that you just made
6. Then run the program as aforementioned

If you do not do this, the program will not work properly.

WARNING: Legal Information
-------

- Use this program only for personal use (e.g., Projects) as YouTube copyright doesn't necessarily enjoy videos being downloaded. So don't hold me accountable for any legal issues or copyright issues you may come across and follow YT TOS as a law-abiding citizen.
